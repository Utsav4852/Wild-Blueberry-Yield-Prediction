# Wild-Blueberry-Yield-Prediction

Blueberries are usually prostrate shrubs that can vary in size from 10 centimeters (4 inches) to 4 meters (13 feet) in height. In the commercial production of blueberries, the species with small, pea-size berries growing on low-level bushes are known as "lowbush blueberries" (synonymous with "wild"), while the species with larger berries growing on taller, cultivated bushes are known as "highbush blueberries". Canada is the leading producer of lowbush blueberries, while the United States produces some 40% of the world s supply of highbush blueberries.

The main goal of this activity is to improve the model score.

Models used for prediction:
- Random Forest Regressor
- Cat Boost Regressor
- Light GBM Regressor
- Voting Regressor

With the help of cross-validation and ensemble learning techniques, the model was able to improve the MAE(Mean Absolute Error) score from 362 to 301.
